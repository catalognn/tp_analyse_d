## Clustering - Mars tutorial
### Large multi-spectral image segmentation: _Representing the geological diversity of the surface of Mars_

_Goal:_ To apply the different concepts studied during the course on clustering on _quantitative_ data, using [Python](https://www.python.org/) language. More precisely, apply clustering to pixels of a multi-spectral image representing the surface of Mars.
