## Principal Component Analysis - Digits tutorial
### Visualization and denoising of handwritten digits

_Goal:_ Refresh Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the associated [Python](https://www.python.org/) formulas. Apply this technique to a simple dataset made up of handwritten digits.

We could take the study a step further by looking at the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) database, which also contains handwritten digits, but in greater detail (dimension $784=28\times28$). In this case, a kernel-PCA decomposition could be used for denoising. This algorithm is outside the scope of this course.
